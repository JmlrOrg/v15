    "abstract": "We present and test an extension of slow feature analysis as a novel approach to nonlinear blind source separation. The algorithm relies on temporal correlations and iteratively reconstructs a set of statistically independent sources from arbitrary nonlinear instantaneous mixtures. Simulations show that it is able to invert a complicated nonlinear mixture of two audio signals with a high reliability. The algorithm is based on a mathematical analysis of slow feature analysis for the case of input data that are generated from statistically independent sources.",

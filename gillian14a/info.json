    "abstract": "The Gesture Recognition Toolkit is a cross-platform open-source C++ library designed to make real-time machine learning and gesture recognition more accessible for non-specialists. Emphasis is placed on ease of use, with a consistent, minimalist design that promotes accessibility while supporting flexibility and customization for advanced users. The toolkit features a broad range of classification and regression algorithms and has extensive support for building real-time systems. This includes algorithms for signal processing, feature extraction and automatic gesture spotting.",

    "abstract": "Structured prediction methods have become a central tool for many machine learning applications. While more and more algorithms are developed, only very few implementations are available. <i>pystruct</i> aims at providing a general purpose implementation of standard structured prediction methods, both for practitioners and as a baseline for researchers. It is written in Python and adapts paradigms and types from the scientific Python community for seamless integration with other projects.",
